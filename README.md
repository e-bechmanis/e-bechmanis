# Welcome!ðŸ‘‹

:information_source: My name is Elena Bechmanis. Iâ€™m a developer based in Toronto, Canada. While I have experience building for the web, I'm currently focused on Android development and secure coding in the fintech space.

:computer: My love for coding still caps my sleep at around 4â€“5 hours a day.

:mortar_board: Iâ€™m currently pursuing a BTech in Software Engineering at McMaster University.

:heart: I enjoy figuring out how things work and the Eureka effect when a tricky problem suddenly clicks into place.
